  </p>

  <p>
    I am a full time mom of six beautiful children. I also am a part time Real Estate Agent. More specifically I work with only first time home buyers to help them navigate the road to home ownership. I feel there is not enough information out there
    to show people that owning a home of their own is not as far out of reach as may seem.
    I have always had a love of technology and found it easy to keep with with todays newest tech abilities. I more recently found a love of web development. I took it upon myself to delve into learning all I could about it and now have made it part
    of my life and income fulltime.
